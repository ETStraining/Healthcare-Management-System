# 🏥 **Healthcare Management System**

## 📋 **Project Description**
This Healthcare Management System is designed to streamline various healthcare facility operations, including managing patient records, scheduling appointments, and handling billing processes. The system is divided into two main applications: the Hospital App and the User App. The Hospital App is intended for use by healthcare providers (doctors, receptionists, etc.), while the User App is for patients to book appointments.
